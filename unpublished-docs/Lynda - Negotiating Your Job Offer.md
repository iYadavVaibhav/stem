**How to Negotiate:**

What to avoid?
- Be prepared, be intelligent
- focus only on salary
- Don;t make it personal, make it professional conversation
- Negotiate on facts and figures.

Salary negotiation myth:
- last salary is low then it does not matter, market value matters
- company can give depending on budget, not last salary.

Negotiations:
- Sign on bonus.
- work from home.
- Relocation assistance.
- Be Prepared.

Reimbushment for relocation? (how much can we claim?)

Sign on bonus (CRR Time, I am expecting bonus)

Down the line, when can I expect 1st increment?

What position am I being hiered? Next role at what experince.

Are there work from home options? if yes then how many?
