    "Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- Amount of time, in worst case scenario, given the lenght of input.\n",
    "- O(1) simple var access - constant time complexity\n",
    "  - given a list, you do not iterate whole list, instead just access one element. even if list lenght iceases, the time will not increase as your function just prints one element.\n",
    "- O(n) loop over list - linear\n",
    "- O(log n) binary search, where you eliminate half result.\n",
    "- O(n^2), for loop within for loop, you iterate over each list element. - quadratic\n",
    "- O(n log n), O(2^n) and O(n!) (n factorial), not common.\n",
    "- You should know time complexity of solution.\n",
    "- If there are multiple steps, time complexity is worst step, that is what we want to know.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Big O**\n",
    "  - O represents order of. O(n) means, the time complexity increases as order of n. If n increases the time increases by it.\n",
    "  - if you plot time and n on graph, let's say eq is $t = an + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constant, then t we see that t increases majorly by $a x n$, which is order of n. hence, `O(n)`. You ignore the co-efficients from the equations.\n",
    "  - For $t = 20$ it is $t = 20 x 1$, hence `O(1)`\n",
    "  - For $t = an^2 + c$, notation is, $O(n^2)$\n",
    "  - Big O does not depend on machine capability, twice fast machine will change coefficient, which is ignored. However, the function complexity will remain the same, that is, constant, linear or quadratic etc irrespective of machine's capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluating Big O\n",
    "  - the assignment operation will have complexity constant, of 1 so $O(1)$\n",
    "  - Now, if this is in for loop, it repeats n times, hence time is $n \\times O(1)$ that will be $O(n)$\n",
    "  - Now, if there is nother for loop outside this, time taken is $n \\times O(n)$, that will be $O(nn)$ or $O(n^2)$\n",
