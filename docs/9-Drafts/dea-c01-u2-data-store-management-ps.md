## 1.0 Data Stores

## 1.1 Introduction to Amazon S3

**Shared Security Model**

- Think of it as your responsibility as home owner vs tenant vs air-bnb vs hotel guest. Your responsibility goes down respectively for the examples here. Similarly in AWS responsibility varies.
- Infra Services such as EC2 requires lot of securing responsibility as you are owner of infra. You own configs, security patches, firewall
- Manages Services like RDS, Container; you need to do minor updates.
- Serverless things like S3, Dynamo; AWS manages everything.
- You need to do
  - Customer data security using IAM
  - Client side encryption
- AWS does:
  - Server side encryption
  - Network Protection
  - Manges platform, OS, NW, Firewall, Global Infra

**Security Layers**

1. VPC, this is first line of defence, like envelop
2. IAM, or Authentication, this is 2nd line of defence, like name and address on letter.
3. encryption, this is third line of defence, even if the message is read, it is meaning less unless you have a decryption key.

**Layer 1: S3 and VPC**

- S3 is accessible over internet. It is independent of VPC.
- But, You can block public access.
  - Once blocked you can only make it accessible via VPC, by making private connection between your bucket and VPC.
  - This private connection allows you to connect to S3 bucket internally without traversing via public internet.

**Layer 2: Access Control**

This has two levels

1. Identity Based
   - AWS IAM Policies: are attached to IAM users, groups, or roles
   - Controls access at a granular level based on user identity

2. Resourced-Based
   - Access Control Lists (ACLs)
     - Grant specific permissions to individual AWS accounts/groups
     - Can be configured on the object level or bucket level
   - Bucket Policies
     - JSON-based policies that you attach to control access at the bucket level

Using above two, you can restrict access to resource as required at desired level.

**S3 Bucket Policies**

- It is a JSON with following keys
- `Effect` tells that it allows or denies
- `Principal` tell who this policy applies to
- `Action` tells get or write
- `Resource` tells on which object the policy is applied to

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:PutObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/*",
    }
  ]
}
```

- S3 bucket policies allow you to specify a degree of fine-grained access to objects in your bucket.
- An eg is that, you can
  - Grant public read access to all objects in an S3 bucket
  - Grace access across accounts
  - Deny unencrypted uploads
  - Define access based on criteria such as:
    - IP addresses
    - IAM user/role

**S3 Access Points**

- This lets more fine grain control on data within a bucket.
- You can allow an access point to read only certain data within a bucket. And this way you can manage different teams with different access to objects in bucket.


**S3 Encryption**

- **Server-Side Encryption** (SSE) - Takes place in AWS.
- **Client-side encryption** - Takes place outside of AWS.

- **Server Side Encryption**
- Also called **AT Rest** encryption
- Either the client or AWS can be in charge of the encryption using Keys
- Two options to do SSE, you can do it using
  1. **Customer Provided Keys (SSE-C)**
     - You use your managed keys during uploading objects on to S3.
  2. **AWS Key Management Service** (KMS), within this you can manage three different keys
     1. AWS Owned Keys - Free, AWS owns and manages
     2. AWS Managed Keys - Chargeable, You own, AWS manages
     3. Customer Managed Keys - Chargeable. You own and manage

- **S3 in transit Encryption**
  - SÂ£ always does the encryption when data is in transit by using SSL/TLS protocols to secure the connection between client and S3

- **Client-side encryption**
  - The client is always in charge of the encryption.
  - Managed by client application.
  - Client app will encrypt the data using keys before the data is sent to AWS.


## 1.2 Amazon S3 Features and Capabilities

- S3 Versioning
  - new version is created each time object is updated or created.
  - On delete, S3 keeps the object but adds a delete marker which tells that object is deleted.
  - Within a bucket, you can configure to version at
    - Object Level - versions specific objects. Eg, version important files but not logs.
    - Bucket Level - if all objects are important.
  - It is chargeable
  - It can't be disabled, only suspended.
  - On suspend, future modifications are not versioned but previous versions remain.

- Replication
  - Replicate objects from one bucket to another.
  - It can be done two ways
    - Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
    - Same-Region Replication (SRR)

  - Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
    - us-east-2 to eu-west-1
    - helpful in disaster recovery
    - compliance and geo redundancy - some compliance may require you to store data in certain regions
    - reduce latency - you can reduce latency by bringing data close to user region.

  - Same-Region Replication (SRR)
    - us-east-1 to us-east-1
    - disaster recovery use case
    - testing - you can sync test and prod
    - caching - you can access frequently accessed data into caching layer

  - S3 supports Asynchronous Replication, that is, once object is written to primary bucket after that it will be written to replica bucket. This is **near real time**, not real time.
  - **Versioning is required for replication**.
  - Once on, old data is not replicated automatically, only newly added data will be. To replicate old data, use S3 Batch Replication.
  - Delete Markers are not replicated by default.

- Notifications
  - You can send notifications on specific events.
  - You can configure S3 to notify you when one of the following events takes place:
    - Creating new objects
    - Removing objects
    - Restoring objects
    - Replicating objects
    - Expired S3 lifecycle events
    - Transitioned S3 lifecycle events
    - Automatic archival events from S3 Intelligent-Tiering
    - Tagging objects
    - PUT ACL objects (access control)
  - You can filter events, example notify create of object only for PNG extension.
  - You can send notifications to:
    - Amazon SNS
    - Event Bridge - can forward to other services
    - Amazon SQS
    - AWS Lambda



## 1.3 Amazon S3 Storage Classes


**S3 Storage Classes**

- S3 offers different storage classes with different pricing, like SSD, HHD etc.

- Determining Ideal Storage Class based on Frequency
  1. Frequently Accessed with low-latency and high-throughput - You often use it, and need it quickly
  2. Infrequent access and slightly low latency but high throughput - You don't often use it, but when needed should be easily accessible and quick to read.
  3. Infrequent, high latency, low throughput - means you rarely access, takes time to fetch, is slow to read. Used for archival data.

- Storages on S3
  1. Amazon S3 Standard - General Purpose Storage - Use case Gaming, Big Data Analytics.
  2. Amazon S3 Standard - Infrequent Storage - Costs less than general. Less frequent accessed but rapid read.
  3. Amazon S3 Glacier - Low cost. For archiving/backing up.

**Infrequent Access - Sub storages**

- Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
  - 99.9% availability in multiple zones
  - Use Cases: Disaster recovery, backups

- Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
  - 99.5% availability in a single zone
  - Use Cases: Storing secondary backup copies of your data


**Amazon S3 Glacier Types**

- Instant Retrieval
  - Offers millisecond retrieval
  - Use Cases
    - Medical images
    - News media assets
    - Data that needs to be accessed on quarterly basis

- Flexible Retrieval
  - Minimum storage duration of 90 days
  - Retrieval Options:
    - Expedited - 1 to 5 minutes
    - Standard - 3 to 5 hours
    - Bulk (Free to retrieve, only storage costs) - 5 to 12 hours

- Deep Archive
  - Minimum storage duration of 180 days
  - For long term storage
  - Retrieval Options:
    - Standard - 12 hours
    - Bulk - 48 hours



**S3 Intelligent-Tiering**

- **Automatically** moves objects between the Access Tiers.
- Incurs a **small monthly fee** for auto-tiering


- Frequent Access Tier - Automatically - Default tier
- Infrequent Access Tier - Automatically - Objects not accessed for 30 days
- Archive Instant Access Tier - Automatically - Objects not accessed for 90 days
- Archive Access Tier - Optional - Configurable from 90 days to 730 days
- Deep Archive Access Tier - Optional - Configurable from 180 days to 730 days


**S3 Select and Glacier Select**

- You can use **S3 Select** to access data in S3. Select-enabled storage classes, such as Standard and Intelligent-Tiering.
- You can use **Glacier Select** to access in Amazon Glacier.
- Both allow you to use simple S**QL statements** to retrieve filtered data.
- Amazon performs server-side filtering which is up to **400% faster and 80% cheaper**.

## 1.4 Amazon S3 Lifecycle Rules


**S3 Lifecycle Rules**

- While Intelligent-Tier allows for automatic moves based on access pattern, but you can create your own rules to move things to different tiers.
- You can use **S3 Lifecycle rules** to move objects between storage classes and access tiers based on explicitly defined criteria. Eg, certain prefix e.g., `s3://my-bucket/jpg/*`

**S3 Actions**

- You can use actions to move objects from one tier to another or delete forever.

- **Transition Actions**
  - Define **when and how** objects should be **moved** from one access **tier** to another.
  - Example: Move objects to Glacier for archiving after one year

- **Expiration Actions**
  - Define at **what age** should objects expire (be permanently deleted)
  - Examples: Delete after a specified retention period for compliance. Delete old version of files (if versioning is enabled)
  - You **won't be charged** for storage **after expiration time**.

**Lifecycle Rule Example Scenario**

- Use case requirements
  - Imagine images is uploaded to S3 and then thumbnails are generated. Eg, movie ticket.
  - Users only requires images to be frequently accessed for 60 days and then can wait for up to 6 hours.
  - Thumbnails can be deleted after 60 days and may get regenerated from original image if required.
- Lifecycle Setup
  - Images are stored in Standard for 60 days
    - Then rule moves them to Glacier after 60 days
  - Thumbnails are store on One-Zone IA as they don't need multi-zone disaster recovery
    - They can expire after 60 days.

**Scenario 2 For Versioning and Lifecycle Rules**

- Use Case
  - Consider that you need to recover deleted file immediately for 30 days.
  - After 30 days you can wait for 42 hours to recover a deleted file.
- **Versioning**
  - You need to enable versioning so that deleted object get deleted marker
- **Lifecycle Rule**
  - Keep objects in **standard class for 30 days**
  - After 30 days, **transition** object **having delete marker** to **Standard Infrequent Access**
  - After 1 year move them to Glacier Depp Archive to save cost.


## 1.5 Amazon S3 Security

**Analytics on Access Patter and Transition**

- You can Generates CSV reports with recommendations on how to transition objects based on
  - Access patterns for S3 objects
    - Access frequency
    - Last access time
    - Total data scanned
  - Cost analysis
- Using these patterns, you can come up with lifecycle rules
  - Object in Standard and Standard IA
  - This feature isn't available for objects stored in One-Zone lA or Glacier


## 1.6 Introduction to Amazon EC2

- EC2 is service on AWS that allows you to **rent the virtual server (compute)** on the cloud.
- Get it **simply** via console or by commands in API.

- **Benefits** compared to physical servers
  - EC2 can **grow and shrink**
  - **Easy to launch** in minutes
  - You **pay less**, only for what you use.

- **Choosing Instance Types** based following
  - Power - how powerful machine is required for use case?
  - CPUs - the CPUs required? eg, `M5-Large` gives 2 vCPUs, while `C54-X-Large` gives 16 vCPUs
  - Memory - the Ram required?

- **General Purpose Instances**
  - **Power**: A balanced performance of compute, memory, and networking resources
  - **vCPUS**: A balanced ratio of vCPUs to memory
  - **Memory**: A balanced ratio of memory to vCPUs
  - Great for diverse workloads
  - Examples include `t3, t3a, t4`

- **Compute Optimized Instances Offer**
  - **Power**: High computational power
  - **vCPUs**: A higher number of vCPUS relative to memory
  - **Memory**: Sufficient memory to support most workloads
  - Great for applications that demand a lot of computational power
  - Examples include `c6g, c5, c5a, c5n`


- **Memory Optimized Instances**
  - **Power**: A large amount of RAM
  - **vCPUS**: Typically offer a lower number of vCPUs compared to other instance types
  - **Memory**: Highest memory capacities
  - Great for memory-intensive workloads
  - Examples include `r5, r5a, r5n`

- **Storage Optimized Instances**
  - **Power**: High-speed storage
  - **vCPUs**: Less vCPUs
  - **Memory**: Moderate to high memory
  - Great for low-latency storage for data-intensive workloads
  - Examples include `13, 13en, d2, h1`

- **EC2 doesn't offer persistent storage**
  - that is, if EC2 is **terminated** the data stored is **lost permanently**.
  - For persistence, you can use EBS or EFS to store data beyond life cycle of ec2.
  - [ ] replace ec2 with EC2. s3 with S3.

- **Elastic Block Storage EBS**
  - It is more **like attached Local Disk to a Computer**
  - Each disc is **mapped to individual EC2**
  - Data is persisted beyond ec2 life.

- **Instance Store**
  - This is a block storage attached to EC2.
  - It persists on reboot, but is lost when hibernated or terminated.
  - It is used more for caching.

- **Elastic File System EFS**
  - It is more like **network storage** or **shared file storage**.
  - It is mounted on to ec2.
  - It is offered by service like EFS for linux, FSx for windows.
  - Used cases, content sharing and distributed file storage.
  - The storage can content can be used by multiple EC2s for different purpose.

**Different types of EBS volumes**

- General Purpose (gp2)
- Provisioned IOPS (io1)
- Throughput Optimized (st1)
- Cold HDD (sc1)
- Magnetic

**EC2 Pricing Models**

- **On Demand**
Allows you pay by the hour or the second, depending on the type of instance.

- **Reserved** - Reserves capacity for 1 or 3 years depending on the contract for up to 72% discount on the hourly charge.

- **Spot** - Allows you to purchase unused capacity at a discount of up to 90%.

- **Dedicated** - A physical EC2 server dedicated for you.

## 2.0 Data Formats ===================

## 2.1 Types of Data Formats

### Organizational Styles and Data Formats Analogy

1. **Ultra Organizer (Structured Data)**:
   - **Highly organized** and follows a **predefined schema** (tables, rows, columns).
   - Data relationships are clearly defined, making it **easily queryable**.
   - Example: **SQL databases, CSV files, spreadsheets**.
   - Like a well-organized closet, you can quickly find what you're looking for.

2. **Semi-Structured (Semi-Structured Data)**:
   - Contains **organizational elements** (tags, keys, attributes) but doesnât follow a rigid schema.
   - Provides some sort of hierarchy
   - More flexible than structured data, but less queryable.
   - Example: **JSON, XML**.
   - Similar to a semi-organized closetârequires some effort to navigate but still manageable.

3. **Chaotic (Unstructured Data)**:
   - Lacks a specific schema, and data relationships are not clear, making it **hard to query**.
   - Requires **pre-processing** before analysis.
   - Example: **Images, audio, video, social media posts, text and docs**.
   - Like a messy closet, difficult to find what you need.

---

### Common Data Formats

1. **CSV (Comma-Separated Values)**:
   - **Structured data** in **tabular form**.
   - Use cases:
     - **Data exchange** between applications (e.g., database export/import).
     - **With Programming Languages**, like python to read and write data. Libraries in programming languages (e.g., Python's CSV module) handle CSV files.
     - **Quick data analysis** with tools like Excel or Google Sheets.
     - **Data backup and archival**, especially for tabular data.
     - **Human Readable and Editable** format.

2. **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**:
   - **Semi-structured data** organized in **key-value pairs**.
   - Use cases:
     - **Configuration files and settings**. Simple, readable.
     - **Data exchange** between web servers and browsers (common in APIs).
     - **High interoperability** across different programming languages.
     - Can be used for **backup and archiving**.

3. **Avro**:
   - Represents data in a way that is **easy to serialize** (convert to binary) **and deserialize** (convert back to original structure)
   - **Row-based format** with **JSON-like syntax** and an _optional_ **declarative schema**.
   - Use cases:
     - **Compact binary format** for smaller payloads.
     - Ideal for **big data processing** (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Kafka).
     - **Easily handles schema changes** without breaking compatibility.
     - Ensures **data validation** and **strict typing** for high interoperability.

   ```json
   // avro data with schema defined
   {
      " type " : "record",
      " name " : "user",
      " fields " : [
         { "name" : " Name" , "type" : "string" },
         { "name" : "age" , "type" : "int" }
      ]
   }
   {
      "name": Vaibhav,
      "age": 32
   }
   ```

4. **Parquet**:
   - Open source, **Column-oriented format** designed for **data warehousing** and analytical queries.
   - Similar to avro, but **data and schema are combined into one**.
   - Use cases:
     - **Efficient data analysis** (e.g., aggregation queries).
     - **Optimized for Hadoop, Spark, Kafka**, and other big data tools.
     - Supports **frequent schema changes** without breaking compatibility.
     - Allows **selective column reading** for faster data access.

---

### Key Differences Between Avro and Parquet

- **Storage Type**:
  - **Avro**: Row-based storage.
  - **Parquet**: Column-oriented storage.

- **Schema Definition**:
  - **Avro**: Uses a **JSON-based schema**.
  - **Parquet**: Uses its own **schema definition language**.

- **Integration**:
  - Both Avro and Parquet are widely used in **Apache ecosystems** (Hadoop, Spark, Kafka).
  - Parquet is **optimized for Impala**, while Avro is **supported** by Impala.


## 2.2 Transforming Data Formats

### ETL and Data Transformation with AWS Glue

**AWS Glue** offers several ways to **transform** data:

- **Python shell jobs** for quick data manipulation.
- **Spark ETL jobs** for large-scale transformations.
- **PySpark or Scala jobs** for batch and streaming data processing.

1. **Python Shell ETL Jobs** in Glue:
   - Suitable for **simpler ETL tasks** (e.g., small datasets).
   - Provides **pre-built libraries** for transforming data between formats, such as **CSV to Parquet**.
   - Libraries for **aggregating data** (e.g., sums, averages) and reading/writing formats.
   - **Use case**: Reading a CSV file from an S3 bucket, converting it to Parquet using the `CSV` module and `PyArrow`.

2. **Spark ETL Jobs** in Glue:
   - Ideal for **complex transformations** and **large-scale data**.
   - Apache Spark is a **distributed computing system** that supports:
     - **Filtering data** based on specific criteria.
     - **Aggregating data** (e.g., sums, averages, counts).
     - **Joining data** from multiple datasets using common keys.
   - **Use case**: Processing **large datasets in Redshift** to identify top-selling products through aggregation.

3. **PySpark or Scala for Batch and Streaming Jobs** in Glue:
   - **Batch Processing**: Processing data in **fixed-size batches** (e.g., daily sales reports).
     - Example: A retail company collects daily sales data in CSV format. PySpark or Scala can read the CSV, transform, and aggregate the data.
   - **Streaming Processing**: Processing data in **micro-batches** at regular intervals (e.g., real-time data analysis).
     - Example: analysing real-time **clickstream data** using Amazon Kinesis and processing it with PySpark or Scala for real-time insights.

## 3.0 Databases ======================

## 3.1 Introduction to Amazon DynamoDB

### AWS DynamoDB

**Overview of DynamoDB**

- **DynamoDB** is a fully managed, **NoSQL non-relational** database service.
- It supports **key-value pairs** and **document data** (JSON, HTML, XML).
- **Flexible** table adaptation, but **lacks joins** and analytical query capabilities.
- **Access patterns** must be defined **before table creation**?
- **Unlimited storage**, with **single-digit millisecond response times**.
- Use **DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)** for **microsecond latency**.
- It is limitless, can handle Terabytes smoothly.

**Benefits of DynamoDB**

1. **Global Tables** across Regions:
   - Replicate data across AWS regions for **fast, responsive access** worldwide.

2. **DynamoDB Streams**:
   - Captures **time-ordered modifications** to database items.
   - That is, it stores any modification to item in a table like created, updated etc.

3. **Partitioning and Availability**:
   - DynamoDB **automatically scales** by partitioning data. You need not take this step.
   - Replicates data across **three availability zones** for **fault tolerance**.

**Use Cases**

- **Media and metadata storage** (photos, videos).
- **Retail applications** (high traffic, e.g., during holidays). It can handle millions of request per second.
- **Gaming platforms** (large-scale data handling).
- **Online transaction processing (OLTP)** (financial transactions, e-commerce).
- **Hierarchical data models** (e.g., employee directories).
- **Fluctuating workloads** (e.g., social media, flash sales).
- **Mission-critical applications** (healthcare, online banking). When downtime is not an option.

**DynamoDB compared to Relational Database**

1. **Tables**: Similar to SQL tables.
2. **Items**: Equivalent to **rows/records** in SQL.
3. **Attributes**: Equivalent to **columns/fields** in SQL.
   - A unique group of attributes forms a **single item**.
   - Max item size is **400 KB**.
4. **Primary Keys**:
   - Consist of one or two attributes.
   - Used to **retrieve data**. Selecting the right primary key is crucial for table design.
   - This is why knowing the **access pattern** is important as based on that you would define the primary key and then based on that you will retrieve the data.


**Time to Live (TTL)**

- Adds an expiry time to items.
- Items are **automatically deleted** once expired, including from **indexes**.
- **Deletion occurs within 48 hours** of expiration.
- Delete data might appear in result, you need to add filter to remove it.

- **Use Case**:
  - Use TTL for **deleting sensitive data**. Add expiry based on contract to keep PII.
  - session data, event logs. Add expiry so that they get auto deleted after time and save on storage costs.
  - for **debugging**. Add expiry to logs so that after debugging logs are auto deleted.

## 3.2 Amazon DynamoDB: Dealing with Rate Limits and Throttling

### DynamoDB Throughput

**Throughput** means **rate** at which data can be **read** and **written** to database. It depends on **Capacity Modes**. You basically can pre-define the unites required or pay as you go (more expensive) if load is unpredictable.

Two capacity modes are:

1. **Provisioned Capacity Mode** - You predict and specify the units in advance.
2. **On-Demand Capacity Mode** - You are charges pay as you go.

### DynamoDB Capacity Modes

**Provisioned Capacity Mode**:

- Throughput is calculated and provisioned using **Read Capacity Units (RCUs)** for read operations and **Write Capacity Units (WCUs)** for write operations.
- Suitable for **predictable traffic** and consistent capacity needs.
- Risk of **over-provisioning** (unnecessary charges) or **under-provisioning** (throttling).
- Offers **consistent performance** with a maximum of **40,000 RCUs/WCUs per table**.
- **Use Cases**: Traffic that is predictable and then ramps up gradually.

**On-Demand Capacity Mode**:

- No need to provision throughput; DynamoDB charges for **Read/Write Request Units**.
- Automatically scales based on demand.
- **More expensive per request** but removes the risk of under/over-provisioning.
- Best for **unpredictable traffic** or new tables with unknown workloads.
- Throttling occurs if demand exceeds **2x the previous peak** within 30 minutes.
- Can switch between modes **every 24 hours**. (on demand to provision and vice versa)
- **Use Cases**: Where load is unpredictable.

**Scaling in Provisioned Mode**

- Auto-scaling available to manage fluctuations in traffic.
- **Auto-scaling**: Adjusts capacity between a defined minimum and maximum range. Range helps control cost.
- **Manual Scaling**: You define the exact capacity units without auto-scaling.
- Recommended to **switch to provisioned mode** once the appâs traffic becomes predictable.

**Over Throttling**

- User may send more read/write request than provisioned. This will throttle and throw `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`. To save from this, **Burst Capacity** comes in.

**Burst Capacity**

- **Burst capacity** provides **temporary additional throughput** by storing unused capacity from partitions for up to **5 minutes** (300 seconds).
- Helpful during traffic spikes, but shouldn't be relied upon as the primary solution.

**Solutions to Avoid Throttling**

1. **Switch to On-Demand Mode**: Avoids under-provisioning issues by automatically scaling capacity.
2. **Increase RCUs/WCUs**: Increase provisioned throughput to match demand.
3. **AWS Application Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjusts provisioned throughput based on traffic.
4. **Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff**: Implement retry logic to delay retries after failures, using an increasing time delay.
5. **Optimize Queries**:
   - Avoid querying unnecessary data.
   - Use **WHERE clauses** to filter and retrieve only necessary data.
   - Use **Projection Expressions** to retrieve specific attributes, reducing capacity usage.
6. **Hot Partition Resolution**:
   - Avoid hot partitions (when one partition receives disproportionate traffic).
   - Analyze **access patterns** and **partition keys** to distribute traffic evenly across partitions.

### DynamoDB Pricing Model

Cost is calculated separately for data storage, data read, data write. So:

- Idle table (not read or written) is only charged for storage and backups.

## 3.3 Amazon DynamoDB: PartiQL

You can read from dynamo db by making API call (something like MongoDB calls), you cannot use SQL directly, however, DynamoDB offers a wrapper which helps you query by SQL Syntax (behind the scene it converts to API calls and hence may not be always efficient).

**PartiQL Editor**

- **PartiQL** is a **SQL-like syntax tool** used to query DynamoDB tables via the **AWS Console**.
- It simplifies working with DynamoDB for developers familiar with SQL, supporting common statements like **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, **SELECT**, and **DELETE**.
- Query results can be displayed in **table view** or **JSON view**.

**Accessing PartiQL**

- You can use PartiQL through:
  - **AWS Console**
  - **AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)**
  - **DynamoDB APIs**
  - **NoSQL Workbench** (a graphical tool you can install locally).

**Behind the Scenes of PartiQL**

- PartiQL queries are automatically translated into **DynamoDB API operations**, but this process isn't _always_ efficient.
- **Scans** and **queries** are the two **DynamoDB operations** relevant to PartiQL.

**Scans vs. Queries**

- **Scans**:
  - It is equivalent to `SELECT *` in SQL.
  - Command: `aws dynamodb scan --table-name`.
  - **Expensive** because they read the entire table and then apply filters after consuming capacity units, leading to high throughput consumption.
  - If table is large, scan and consume your throughput capacity quickly..

- **Queries**:
  - It lets you find items using **primary key**, hence reads less data and is **cost effective**.
  - Less expensive than scans, as they consume fewer capacity units.
  - Command: `aws dynamodb query --table-name`

**Best Practices to Avoid Inefficient PartiQL Queries**

1. **Deny Scan Operations**:
   - Use **AWS IAM policies** to deny scan permissions for the identity running PartiQL statements.

2. **Create Secondary Indexes**:
   - Write queries that utilize these indexes to target specific data and improve performance.

3. **Monitor Query Performance**:
   - Regularly analyze query performance to detect and resolve full scans early.

## 3.4 Amazon Redshift Distribution Styles


**Distribution Styles Overview**

- Distribution styles determine how data is spread across compute nodes in an **Amazon Redshift** cluster. There are four main styles:

1. **EVEN** Style:
   - Data is distributed **evenly** across all compute nodes, regardless of any column values.
   - Best suited for **balanced workloads**.
   - Recommended for tables that **don't participate in JOIN operations** to avoid data skew.

2. **KEY** Style:
   - Data is distributed based on specific **key values**, where **identical key values are placed on the same compute node**.
   - Ideal for **JOIN-heavy queries** when there is a clear distribution key.

3. **ALL** Style:
   - The entire table is **replicated** across all nodes.
   - Suitable for **small, static tables** that don't undergo frequent updates.
   - Not recommended for frequently written tables, as changes must be applied to every node in the cluster.

4. **AUTO** Distribution:
   - Redshift automatically determines the best distribution style based on the table size and characteristics.
   - May initially use the **ALL style** for small tables and switch to **EVEN style** as the table grows.
   - Recommended when the **table size is unpredictable** or if you're unsure which style to choose.

**Recommendations**

- Use **EVEN** for non-JOIN tables.
- Use **KEY** for JOIN-heavy queries with a clear distribution key.
- Use **ALL** for small, static tables that aren't frequently updated.
- Use **AUTO** if the table size is likely to change or when you're uncertain which distribution style fits best.


## 3.5 Amazon RedShift Workload Management (WLM)

**Superstore Analogy**

- Consider the checkout system of superstore, there can be different type of queues
  - based on quantity (customer with trolley, or customer with one item)
  - based on type (premium customer, priority maternity disables old, regular)
- These queues need to be manged, such as full trolley customer does not block single item person, old people can go to another queue and so on.

- **Amazon Redshift Workload Management** also offers **queue management** in _similar_ way:
  - Long-running queries (quantity based)
  - Short fast-running queries queue (quantity based)
  - Data Analytics queue (role based)
  - Superuser queue (role based)

**Purpose of WLM**

- Redshift **Workload Management (WLM)** helps prioritize and manage queries to optimize system performance.
- It categorizes queries into **distinct queues** based on roles, query types, or importance. For example, there can be queues for:
  - **Long-running queries**
  - **Short and fast-running queries**
  - Specific roles like **data analytics** teams
- There is also a default **super user queue** for critical system operations such as administration and maintenance.

**Benefits of WLM**

- **Prevents long-running queries** from holding up short queries.
- Ensures **high-priority queries** (e.g., system-critical tasks) are not delayed by exploratory or less important queries.

**Setting Up WLM**

- WLM is configured through **parameter groups** in Redshift, which manage database settings.
- Up to **eight queues** can be created, each with its own **concurrency level** (number of concurrent queries).
  - For example, if the concurrency level is set to 1, only one query can run at a time in that queue; if set to 5, five queries can run simultaneously.

**WLM Modes**

1. **Automatic Mode**:
   - Redshift **manages concurrency** and **resource allocation** (like memory) automatically based on query workload.
   - Useful for demanding queries (e.g., hash joins between large tables) where Redshift will **lower concurrency for better performance**.
   - Offers **priority settings** (CRITICAL, HIGHEST, HIGH, NORMAL, LOW, LOWEST) to assign importance to queries.
   - **Default mode** for Redshift's default parameter group.

2. **Manual Mode**:
   - Requires creating a **custom parameter group** and manually managing concurrency.
   - You can set a **concurrency level** of up to **50** per queue and for all queues combined.
   - Redshift automatically creates two **default** queues:
      - A queue with a concurrency level of **5**.
      - A **super user queue** with a concurrency level of **1**.

**Key Considerations**

- Even in **automatic mode**, AWS recommends creating a separate **custom parameter group** for better control over configurations.
- WLM is ideal for balancing query workloads, avoiding bottlenecks, and ensuring critical tasks are prioritized effectively.

## 4.5 Self Discovering Schemas in AWS Glue

### Data Lake and AWS Glue - Study Notes

**Data Lake Overview**

- A **data lake** is a centralized repository designed to store, process, and secure large volumes of data in its **raw format** (native format).
- It acts as a **single source of truth**, consolidating various data types from multiple sources into a consistent store.
- **Purpose**: Avoids data silos by integrating different forms of data into one system.

**ETL Process in a Data Lake**

- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**: A common data integration process used by data engineers.
  1. **Extract**: Data is pulled from multiple sources.
  2. **Transform**: Data is validated and transformed to meet quality rules.
  3. **Load**: Data is loaded into target systems for downstream consumption (APIs, reports).

- **Flow Example**:
  - Data extracted from sources enters the data lake (e.g., **Amazon S3**).
  - Data is transformed and validated according to business rules.
  - Processed data is loaded into a target database for business users.

**AWS Glue in the ETL Process**

- **Storage Layer**: **Amazon S3** serves as the storage layer for the data lake.
- **AWS Glue**:
  - **Crawls** data in S3 to infer schema and creates the **AWS Glue Data Catalog**.
  - **Transforms and loads** data into the target database using **Glue ETL scripts**.

**AWS Glue Data Catalog Population**

1. **Automatic Schema Discovery**:
   - The **Glue Crawler** automatically analyses the data and identifies metadata (column names, data types) without manual intervention.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for scenarios where data changes frequently.

2. **Manual Schema Definition**:
   - Users explicitly define the schema (column names, data types, etc.).
   - **Use Case**: Best for stable data environments or when specific schema requirements must be enforced.

## 4.6 Optimization Techniques for Improving Query Performance

### Query Performance Optimization Techniques - Study Notes

1. **Indexing**

   - **Purpose**: Speeds up data retrieval by avoiding full table scans.
   - **Analogy**: Similar to a book index or table of contents that helps you find specific information without scanning the whole book.
   - **Examples**:
     - **Spreadsheets**: Rows and columns are indexed to reference specific cells.
     - **SQL Databases**: Indexes are created on table columns to speed up queries.
     - **Relational Tables**: Primary keys and unique constraints act as indexes to improve retrieval performance.

2. **Partitioning**

   - **Purpose**: Divides large datasets into smaller, more manageable subsets called **partitions** to reduce the amount of data scanned and enable parallel processing.
   - **Example Use Cases**:
     - **Time-Based Partitioning**: Sales data partitioned by month, quarter, or year. Queries targeting a specific period (e.g., Q4) can access that partition directly, skipping irrelevant data.
     - **Alphabetical Partitioning**: Customer data partitioned by the first letter of last names (e.g., A-C, D-F) for faster lookups.
   - **Benefit**: Allows parallel processing, which is faster than sequential scanning of the entire dataset.

3. **Compression**

   - **Purpose**: Reduces the storage space required for data by encoding it in a more compact form.
   - **Trade-Off**: Compression and decompression consume CPU resources, so it's important to assess whether the storage savings justify the CPU overhead.
   - **Examples**:
     - Common compression techniques include **GZIP**, **ZIP**, **GZ**, and **RAR**.
     - **Amazon Redshift** has built-in compression algorithms like **`LZOP`**, **BZIP2**, and **GZIP** to optimize data storage in its fully managed warehouse.

**Summary of Benefits**:

- **Indexing**: Improves query speed by providing direct access to data without full scans.
- **Partitioning**: Reduces the amount of data scanned and enables faster parallel processing.
- **Compression**: Reduces storage costs but requires careful consideration of CPU trade-offs.

## 4.7 Schema Evolution and Updating Data Catalogs

### Schema Changes and Data Transformation in AWS Glue - Study Notes

**Updating Data Catalogs**

1. **Manual Approach**:
   - Update the data catalog via the **Glue Console** or manually trigger **Glue Crawlers** to re-scan data sources and update metadata.

2. **Programmatic Approach**:
   - Use **AWS Glue APIs**, **AWS SDKs** (like Boto3 in Python), or ETL scripts (like **pandas** or **PySpark**) to update the catalog.

3. **Automated Approach**:
   - Schedule **AWS Glue Crawlers** to run periodically, ensuring the catalog stays up-to-date with schema changes.
   - **AWS CloudFormation** can automate catalog updates alongside other infrastructure components.

**Schema Evolution Methods**:

1. **Schema Updates**:
   - Directly modify schemas (e.g., add/delete columns) while preserving underlying data.

2. **Partitioning**:
   - Add or remove partitions (e.g., yearly data) by updating metadata about the partition's location, format, or compression.

3. **Table Updates**:
   - Create/delete tables, update table properties, or change table ownership (i.e., AWS account or IAM role).

4. **Index Changes**:
   - Alter indexes (used to improve query performance), which requires reflecting these changes in the data catalog.

**Impact of Schema Changes**:

1. **Deleting Columns**:
   - You wonât be able to query deleted columns, though the underlying data remains.

2. **Adding Columns**:
   - New columns can be queried. You may fill them with `null`, default values, or existing data.

3. **Changing Data Types**:
   - AWS will interpret columns according to the new data type, but this may cause **conversion errors** or inconsistencies if the data can't be cast to the new type.

**ETL Data Transformation Techniques**:

1. **Custom Transformations**:
   - User-defined functions created from scratch (Python/Scala).
   - Example: Converting data formats (JSON to Avro).

2. **Built-In Transformations**:
   - Predefined functions for common tasks:
     - **DropFields**: Remove specific columns.
     - **DropNullFields**: Remove columns with all `null` values.
     - **Filter**: Filter rows based on criteria.
     - **Join**: Combine datasets on common keys (like SQL joins).
     - **Map**: Modify each record, perform external lookups, etc.
     - **ResolveChoice**: Resolve schema inconsistencies (e.g., convert mixed data types).

**Data Structures in AWS Glue**:

1. **DataFrames**:
   - Commonly used for structured data (rows/columns).
   - Requires **manual schema updates** if there are changes.
   - Supported by **Apache Spark** APIs.

2. **DynamicFrames**:
   - Designed for semi-structured data.
   - Supports schema evolution automatically.
   - Used with **AWS Glue's built-in scripts** for transformations.

**Machine Learning Transformations in AWS Glue**:

- AWS Glue has specialized **ML transformations** for tasks like:
  - **Deduplication**: Identifying duplicate records.
  - **Record Linkage**: Linking related records from different sources.
  - **Data Quality Enhancement**: Improving overall data quality.
- Example: **FindMatches** operation for deduplication, determining the likelihood of records referring to the same entity.
