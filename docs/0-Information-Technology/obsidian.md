# Obsidian

The obsidian way:

- **Atomic notes:**
  - Small, self-contained. It boosts clarity and reusability.
- **Link over Hierarchy:**
  - Less tags and folders:, rely on [[wikilinks]] and map. Not hierarchy.
  - No silos, notes should be interconnected.
- **Graph and Map:**
  - Let backlink show hidden connection in your knowledge.
- **Quick Workflow:**
  - Use inbox for quick dump, templates to structure. Then merge with main note.
- **Progress Over Perfection**:
  - Don’t over-organize. Just start capturing and linking thoughts. Structure will emerge.
- **Questions:**
  - [ ] how much and what to link?

I want to use obsidian
- to have my wiki notes about knowledge
- backup my notes to github private repo
- to manage my workflow: idea / goal -> project -> task
- Kanban to manage
- manage people, and conversation


**Folder Structure:**

```sh
/Inbox        → Quick captures, unprocessed notes  
/Daily        → Daily notes & logs  
/Notes        → Atomic notes (ideas, concepts)  
/Projects     → Active projects or goals  
/Templates    → Reusable note templates  
```


**Daily Workflow:**

- Start in `Daily Notes`
- Capture tasks, thoughts, links
- Use `[[ ]]` to link to or create new notes
- Move useful ideas to `/Notes` and link them
