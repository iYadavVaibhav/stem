_all about agile, scrum, sprints_


- Retrospective
  - What did we do well?
  - What should we have done better?
  - actions to take based on "What should we have done better"
  - actions taken from last retro actions? else carry them
  - Learnings
    - don't under estimate tasks
    - keep buffer capacity for meetings/PR-requests

- Backlog Grooming / Refinement
  - Break stories into smaller **tasks**
  - Tasks have "Definition of Ready" DoR - covers requirements coming into the sprint
  - Tasks are **prioritized**, estimated

- Sprint Planning
  - Ahead of our sprint planning:
    - Please update your capacity for the next sprint. link
    - Please create, estimate and assign tasks with "definition of done" DoD
    - Update tasks in current sprint.
  - Meeting for 2-4 hours for 2 week sprint
  - Know Memebers, their role, capacity and leaves. Ideally tabular.
  - In Last Sprint
    - Ensure all tasks are updated - in review, done or whatever
    - End the sprint and move all unfinished tasks to backlog or new sprint
  - Start & End Date - know and update it
  - Sprint Goal(s) - have predefined and refine at end
  - Tasks to have
    - Acceptace Criteria
    - Definition of Done - covers product coming out of the sprint
    - Estimated and assigned
    - Reestimate tasks carried forward

Backlog Grooming vs Sprint Planning

- Scope - BG looks at entire project for months, SP looks at near future for weeks
- Grain - BG breaks into tasks, SP breaks in to sub-tasks
- Detail - BG adds DoR, SP adds DoD
