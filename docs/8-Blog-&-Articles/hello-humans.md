# Hello Humans

Here is my first post on GitHub using Jekyll and I turn to my last in twenties. Phew..! life passes fast.. isn't it?

Well, time ticks at it's own pace. So much to learn and so less time. World is running and so are we. Run.. chase your dreams.. rise and shine.. but remember, we are humans blessed enough to enjoy mother earth. Life is a journey, enjoy all ups and downs.

Here, I basically write notes of what I learn and what I do. This helps me refer back and keep a log of how I did something. I was saving my notes locally and randomly so thought of putting them onto GitHub to centralize them and make them available to the world.

A few posts here might not be very well document or in polished manner as they are quick notes to refer back. However, I do include the most essential part and try not to break the flow in understanding a concept.

Thanks for landing here. A quote from Steve Jobs' speech at Harvard:

> Stay Hungry.. Stay Foolish.. ;)

Cheers...!
