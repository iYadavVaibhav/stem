Time is finite:

- Do **most important** and **impactful** thing that works towards the **goal of business**
- Do this thing in **most efficient way** to make best use of your time.

This will get you recognised, and you will climb the ladder fast.

Don't do because someone has asked to do. Do things consciously, you do because you have decided to do, and said yes as you have thought about it.

Pre work, know the goals of the business, talk to, product, sales, marketing, customer support and finance teams, these are close to business. Lunch with them.

Ask

- **Why** would you build a dashboard, or churn model, or a pipeline
- what **impact**
- what **if not**, impact if it is not built
- what will you stop doing if you say yes to new thing, as you have limited time.

Ask as many why as possible, until you are satisfied with ask, or invalidate the ask, to **come up with new ask** that actually helps business to achieve the goal. Think like you know everything and you should ask question so that you can deliver the right thing, just like **doctor**.

- | Can Do | Can Do | -
-|-|-|-
Shouldn't Do | Delegate/Refuse | Execute | Should Do
Shouldn't Do | Avoid* | Learn | Should Do
-| Can't Do | Can't Do | -

_Avoiding is most important, many professionals get stuck there._

Identify your role, **create visibility** through data.

**Metrics and Dimensions**

- Are the metrics correct
- Do you have correct definitions
- Do you have enough dimensions to go under the hood and find the root cause of impact?
- Build missing data to get real insight.

**Learn Business Patterns**

There are common patterns in many business, identify them. It will help you when you will switch jobs, move roles. Eg

- ROI - can you map total investment and return on it, completely?
- Funnel - is funnel complete, how funnel look by different dimensions.
- Competition - add their data, scrape, news article, public info.

Never eat alone. You eat 3 meals, 52 weeks, 5 days a week that gives, 780 opportunities to learn new things!

To overcome shyness, be prepared with list of questions, you are not there to impress them or make them feel happy, treat it as an interview. Be prepared for rejection/ NOs, not good replies. But 50% will be Yes/Good and that will make an impact.
