## Build confidence and crush doubt

- Start with belief and not talent. That is you can do it and not that you have talent to do it.
- build the confidence through repetition. Keep reminding.
- use physical clues to refocus. Like deep breath. Business suit.
- have affermations to yourself - you can code complex stuff, you can present to people clearly.
- build a grag sheet for yourself, you praise yourself. don't share this with others but keep reminding how good you are.
- draw energy from positive people, meet them. Like sunil mausaji, tony knock.
- Practice this as this is a skill, not one time read. You will shine and the people you lead will shine too.
