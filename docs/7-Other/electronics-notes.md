*Notes about IOT, Electronics etc.*

## Volts Amps Ohms Watts Hours

**Voltage (V) Volts** - pressure of water, or how fast the electrons are moving. volt can be measured in parallel, stays same.

**Current (I) Amps** - amount of water, or number of electrons moving. Amps can be measured in series, stays same. The current through the load depends on the load and not on the supply. 2A supply means it can support load upto 2A, means it has enough electrons to move current upto 2A, however, the current drawn from supply in a circuit depends on the resistance in it, it **does not depend on the supply**. Higher resistance is less electrons flowing thru, hence less Amps.

**Resistor (R) Ohm** - can be added in series to resist current (drops volts), so that bulb doesn't blow. bands tell ohms.

$$ V = I.R , Ohm's Law $$

**Power (P) Watts** - Power or rate of energy transfer or used.

$$ P = V.I = \frac{V^2}{R} = I^2.R $$

**Que** - Caculate resitance required to power less volt component (LED) from high volt battery. You need:

- fwd_voltage = electronic component = LED = 3.2 volts
- source_volt = battery used / supply = 9v
- amps = component amps = amps of LED = 24mA

R = V / I , here find V remaining to be consumed by R, Amps remains same in series.

R = (source_volt - fwd_volt) / Amps

R = (9-3.2) / 0.024 = 240 ohms

- This resistor should be added in series to LED. Here, as in series, resistor is taking some volt and led is taking some volt.

## How current flows in circuit?

- current only flows when there is potential difference,
- current is drawn only when there is space for electrons to move, or the cricuit conducts.
- we can only change volts of source, but current drawn depends on load. we cannot provide high current.
- current is amount of electrons flowing, depends inversely on resistance in circuit.
- volts is pressure or how fast electrons are flowing.
- a load, say LED, can only allow few electrons to move through (current) and at some pressure/pace (volts). if we increase volts, it will burn.
- low resistance will allow more current to flow, hence more watts.
- high resistance allows less current to flow, in series it drops volts, or reduces pressure.
- in parallel current gets multiple routes to move, hence overall current increases and resistance drops.
- in series, resistances offer more restrictions hence less current and more resistance,
- Hence
  - Series, I is same, V is different
  - Parallel, I is diff, V is same.
- **Example:** A bulb, has resistance, this defines its volts and watts, say, 4V 1W for bike meter and 4v 20W for headlight. Volt can vary and hence Current and Watts will:
  - 4V 1W => 16ohm (fixed), draws 0.25A
  - now connect this to 12V source
  - 12V 16ohm => draws 0.75A, becomes 9W.
  - this is why the bulb blows when connected to high volts.

**Amp Hours** - measures battery capacity, as in steady current flowing through one hour. 150Ah, inverter battery will give 15A for 10hours. A typical car battery with 12 volts rating has a capacity of 48 Ah. It means that when fully charged, the battery can deliver one amp for 48 hours, two amps for 24 hours and so on.

- Capacitor in parallel prevent jerk and high volts reply. Reduces plasma.
- add 1kohm resistor in series to prevent damage by current.
- resistor could drop current however, the supply volt varies, to cover this use IC to for volt drop. To cover heat loss, and make efficient use 'DC-DC step-down buck converter'. 90% efficient. Ususally in car charger to convert 12v to 5v, [more](https://www.quora.com/Does-a-resistor-reduce-current-and-voltage#:~:text=%2C%20BA-,Philosophy,-%26%20History%2C%20Vrije%20Universiteit)..

## Arduino KIT

**Arduino** boards having microporcessor. single board computer. uno for begineers, nano for breadboard. Kit has related components. It is open source microcontroller. It comes original and compatible copies. Arduino nano is 125 each and can be used as processing unit.

It has libraries same like python to do complex stuff. Install using library manager.

**LED** with 220ohm

- 12mA current, LED 2V, Resistor 2.7

**Active Buzzer** makes sound. It has IC for sound, green circuit is passive, black is active. Active makes sound on current while passive needs square waves with 2K and 5K freq. So we can send high low signal to a pin, varying by a delay of 1 to 10 ms. THis will make sound with freq depending on delay. We can pass notes to passive buzzer and make play any song.

**Tilt Sensor** are used to detect inclination or orientation. They are reliable, low-power, long- lasting and very inexpensive. Can tell arduino about on/off based on orientation, then based on that we can make another component operate, like making LED on/off.

**servo motor** is a geared one, only capable of rotating 180 degrees and is commanded by transmitting electrical pulses from your Arduino. Brown wire is GND, Red is 5V, orange is signal. Signal can be position 0-180, this will make servo move that degree as quickly as possible, then we can delay.  Need servo lib.

**Ultrasonic sensor** can measure distance, HC-SR04 is inexpensive and very easy to use. Need lib. capacity of 2cm to 400cm

**DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor**, The sensor includes a sensor of wet components and a temperature measurement device. It returns binary data string, which is the coverted by library to tell temp and humidity.

**Analog Joystick Module** is used to control components. 5 pins, GND, VCC +5, X, Y, SW Key. It has XY analog output which gives direction with magnitude. and key is digital.

- Key on press connects to GND. Todo: A pull-up resistor or pull-down resistor is a resistor used to ensure a known state for a signal. To get accurate readings from the Key/Select pin, it should be connected to VCC with a pull-up resistor, which we can do using the built in resistors on the UNO digital pins
- Range of X or Y is from 0-1024, mid value is approx 512.
- Switch is 1/0 pressed or free.

**IR Module** using lib, we can program IR receiver.

  - R/W: A Read/Write pin that selects reading mode or writing mode
  - E: An enabling pin that causes the LDC module to execute relevant instructions when supplied with low-level energy.
  - D0-D7:Pins that read and write data
  - A and K: Pins that control the LED backlight
- The LCD display requires six UNO pins as digital outputs. Additionally, it needs 5V and GND connections.
- We need to set Potentiometer to control brightness of Letter (not backlit) and then reset Arduino to display.

**Thermistor** is simply a thermal resistor - a resistor that changes its resistance according to the temperature. 100ohm or more per degree.

**74HC595 Shift Register**

- The shift register is a kind of chip containing eight memory locations, with the values 1 or 0. We input the data using the 'Data' and 'Clock' pins of the chip to set these values on or off. 8 clock pins and 8 data pins. We can combine this with arduino analog PWN write to control brightness of LED.
- Serial to Parallel Converter - useful to power multiple LEDs from one output pin.
- Pin 1 of the chip is to the left of this notch. +5v
- Pin, Q0.

- using 555 timer IC - IP 4.5v-16v, OP <200mA. pin1 ground, pin8 +ve.
- Motor, 12V, 1.5A. It needs more current, so we use mosfet  to power 12v motor and use signal from 555.
- Mosfet - IRFZ24N - <17A, <55V - uses small current in gate pin1 to output more current from drain pin2. Source pin3 is ground. No current in gate, no flow of current. More volt in gate, more volts from drain.- Current to gate is given by 555 pin3. This volt is on/off pulse. this gives average volts and called Pulse Width Modulation.
- Add 1k ohm resistor in series b/w 555pin3 and mosfetpin1 to prevent 555 in case mosfet malfunctions and allows 12v to flow. Also add 1k ohm resistor in parallel to discharge this current. Need Explaination.
