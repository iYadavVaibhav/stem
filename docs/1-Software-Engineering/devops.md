# DevOps

It is a methodology that brings, development, QA and IT operations close together, automated and test driven, container based to have isolated similar environment so that the changes are minimal and are tested and hence donâ€™t break.

## CI/CD Pipeline

- CI/CD stands for Continuous Integrationa and Continuous deployment.
- it is DevOps methodology to being IT and Ops together.
- It is a series of steps to deliver new version of software. Improves delivery throughout SDLC (software development life cycle) which is development, testing, production and monitoring. These steps can be automated to make it error free and fast.
- Steps may include - compiling code, unit tests, code analysis, security and binaries creations. And/or packaging code into container image.
- benefits, includes early integrating and testing, enhancing developer productivity, accelerating delivery, and finding/fixing bugs faster.
- commit to production is continuous and automated.
- CI/CD pipelines are completely tailor-made based on the needs and requirements and could have multiple stages and jobs, and could be complex and comprehensive.

```

- CI-CD has increased over years because on cloud-native development it is much more efficient way and is more required way. Compared to traditional Virtual-Machine deployment where it could had been left to be done manually

- CI-CD Implementation
  - Typically building a CI/CD pipeline consists of the following phases/stages.
    - Code: Checked into the repository.
    - Build: Build is triggered and deployed in a test environment.
    - Test: Automated tests are executed.
    - Deploy: Code is deployed to stage, and production environments.

## Containers

- Containers are **packages of code** together with **necessary elements** (like runtimes, libraries) required to run a software on any environment.
- application is **abstracted** from environmant on which they run. It makes software run anywhere, be it on-prem, cloud or personal-laptop. container is packaged in a way that it can run on any OS and it makes **shared use** of resources like CPU, Memory, Storage and Network at OS level.
- **Separation** of Responsibilities - if you use containers, developers only code and containerize without worrying about deploment env, IT-Ops only deploy container without worrying about version, dependencies, OS-requirements.
- Compared to Virtual-Machines, Containers are **lightweight**, use less resource and virtualize at the **OS level** while VMs virtualize at the hardware level, use more resouse and are heavy.

## Kubernetes

- lets you **manage containers**
- automated container orchestration project
- manages containers, machine and services
- improves reliability and reduces time on devops
- `Google Kubernetes Engine` (GKE) - Is Google cloud kubernetes **service**
- `Kubernetes cluster` is a **set of nodes** that run containerized applications.
- `Edge computing` is a distributed computing paradigm that brings **computation and storage closer** to the sources of data. Often called 'The Edge' or 'at the edge'. Good for time-sensitive data.

## Docker

_moved to docker notes in Information Technology. Link: [Docker Notes](../0-Information-Technology/docker.md)_

## Jenkins

- open source **automation server** that facilitates **automating CI** (Continuous Integration) and DevOps by automating build, test, deploy.
- it is orchestration tool, that manages 'chain of actions' to acieve CI.
- it is used to implement CI/CD workflows as pipelines.
- it is written in Java
- automation reduces time, minizes error, makes release frequent.

- CI - on commit, code is build, then tested. if test is passed, build is tested for deployment. if deployment is successful on UAT, code is pushed to PROD.
- Jobs (collection of steps) is called stages.
- Alternatives - `Github Actions`

## Github Actions

- GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline.
- You can create workflows that has jobs, and its trigger.
- on an event, job(s) gets triggered, that has steps, which can be actions or script to execute.

## Chef DevOps

- for Automating Infrastructure Management
- Chef is an automation tool that provides a way to define infrastructure as code. Infrastructure as code (IC) simply means that managing infrastructure by writing code.
