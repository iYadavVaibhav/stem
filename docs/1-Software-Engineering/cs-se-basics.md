# Software Engineering

*all about standards, conventions, ethics, practices*

## Coding Best Practices - Ways of Working

- Follow coding standards
- Use git
- Write Unit testing - use code to test the small units of programme, test standalone modules.
- Write integration testing - use code to test if modules work correclty when connected together.
- Do funcitonal testing - as a tester, test the functionality of the application.
- Test business outcomes, verify by business people
- Work with people smarter than you
- do pair programming

## Open Source Contribution

- Why? - It is a great way to grow and evovle, learn, build your skill and be part of community, grow your network, showcase your presence.

## Working on someone else's code

- Start a debugger
- Step into and over, understand the variable values, add breakpoints.

## Coding Naming Conventions

- Python - Use underscores
- Javascript - Camel Case
- files and folders - use hyphen. Link [google style guide](https://developers.google.com/style/filenames#naming-guidelines)

## Computer Science

- **Thread** is the smallest sequence of instructions that can be managed independently. It is common for a process to have multiple active threads, sometimes sharing resources such as memory or file handles. Multithreaded web servers start a pool of threads and select a thread from the pool to handle each incoming request.

- **Daemon** - In multitasking computer operating systems, a daemon is a computer program that *runs as a background process*, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user.

- **Unix Domain Socket** or Unix-Socket is endpoint for data communication between processes. Eg, Docket client (process-1) and Docker daemon (process-2) communicate using a REST API over Unix Sockets.

## OOPS

- Object is a Class and has
  - `attributes` - variables
  - `methods()` - functions
